<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Love to type codes. Cook for lunch and sometimes late supper during weekend. Do backpack/cheap travelling to visit and enjoy sight seeing and culture around Indonesia. Loves coloring--just like old days when I was 5. Loves snapping scenery, food and any random things around her using her phone. Yes, she doesn't own any camera yet :p </p>


<p>First encounter to Ruby on Rails was in mid 2015 at Cookpad. Since then she loves to learn about RoR</p>
